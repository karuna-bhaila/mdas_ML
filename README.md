# MDaS Boot camp: Machine Learning Python

This repository contains slides and code for the Spring session of MDaS boot camp on Machine Learning. 

## Objectives
The boot camp is divided into two 1.5-hour sessions and has been structured to introduce Python usage for Machine Learning using the scikit-learn library. By the end of these sessions, students will be able to perform data pre-processing and implement simple ML models from sklearn and analyze their results. 

The following models will be discussed during the sessions:

- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Perceptron

## Installation 
Please refer to the [Fall boot camp](https://github.com/karuna-bhaila/mdas_python) for a brief introduction to Python programming (numpy, pandas, matplotlib) and instructions for installation. The code is provided in Python notebook format and can be run via [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [Google colab](https://colab.google/)

Install Python packages via pip

    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
